Differences from the v1:

* Encoded the ED separately to deal with the scrolling credits without also
  doing Bad Things to the rest of the episode.
* Encoded the OP separately to try and make it look less shitty. I swear they
  pulled that thing off of VHS.
* Changed the 5.1 track to be AC3, rather than AAC.
* Gave the audio and subtitle tracks more descriptive names.

Eventually I'll v3 with nice styled subtitles and anything else I decide needs
fixing.
