# Staff

`open-source-subs` does not have staff in the traditional release-group sense;
instead, we have a core team of people who can commit changes to the canonical
trunk and make releases, and contributors, who are anyone that ever contributes
a fix or improvement.

## Core Team

<span class="bio">
![Xiong Chiamiov](/media/images/xiong_chiamiov.jpg)
**Xiong Chiamiov** is the founder and current [BDFL] of open-source-subs, as
well as the only member. He has next to no experience in any of the jobs
required for this sort of thing, but is enough of an optimistic that he thought
he'd try anyways. A chronic procrastinator who is much better at starting things
than finishing them, Xiong wishes for your involvement.
