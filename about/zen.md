# Zen

Softsubs are better than hardsubs.  
Matroska is the One True container.  
Ordered chapters save valuable space.  
All video should be done in h264.  
And all audio should be done in... something.  
Subtitles are meant to be read.  
Although pretty isn't bad.  

Honorifics are useful.  
But not translating words is stupid.  
TL notes should be used sparingly.  
America is not the center of the world - don't localize to it.  
Over-liberalness is akin to fakesubbing.  
But liberal is better than strict.  

Take criticism politely.  
The BDFL's pronouncements are final.  
Unless he changes his mind.  
"For Life" just means "for a little while".  

Do not take praise too seriously.  
Be direct when dealing with users.  
Which means sometimes telling them to fuck off.  

Request external edits get merged back.  
But don't get angry if they don't.  
v2s should be expected.  
As should v3s, v4s and v5s.  

Open discussion is good.  
Open reasons are good.  
Open scripts are good.  
Open changesets are good.
